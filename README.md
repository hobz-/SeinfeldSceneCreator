Backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/hobz-/SeinfeldSceneCreatorBackend).

This is a project app, which allows the user to create Seinfeld Scenes in their browser. It uses the giphy api for selecting gifs, and will upload the final result to imgur, if the file size < 10MB. If the file is larger than this, the image will be presented to the user to download for themselves.
